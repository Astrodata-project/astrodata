# AstroData ML Toolkit

AstroData is a modular Python toolkit for data processing, machine learning, and experiment tracking, designed for astrophysical data workflows. It provides robust pipelines for data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and experiment tracking with integrated support for Git and DVC.

## Features

- **Data Pipelines**: Modular data loaders, processors, and schemas for handling raw and processed data.
- **Preprocessing**: Utilities for normalization, one-hot encoding, and custom preprocessing steps.
- **Machine Learning**: Abstract base classes and utilities for metrics, model selection, and model management.
- **Experiment Tracking**: Integrated code and data tracking using Git and DVC, with MLflow support.
- **Extensible**: Easily extend with custom data processors, models, and metrics.
